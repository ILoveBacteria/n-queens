## Description

The popular n-queens problem is implemented with **Genetic Algorithm**.
I should admit for 10-queens in 30000 iterations, it didn't find a solution :(

## How to run?

By default, the count of queens is `10` and the maximum iteration is `30000`.
You can change these values whatever you want.

Simply run the code:
```shell
pipenv run python main.py
```
